Fuzzy Finder
============

A fuzzy finder for your WordPress admin.

It only finds items in your admin navigation menu for now.

## Installation

The plugin files are in ```/dist/```. Upload this directory to your plugins directory. Might want to name the directory fuzzy-finder. You're call, though.

## Usage

From any admin screen, use the ```ctrl``` ```shift``` ```f``` shortcut to load the finder. Start typing your search term. Enjoy.
